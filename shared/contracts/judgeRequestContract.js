/**
 * judgeRequestContract.js
 *
 * THE canonical request-body shape for POST /api/judge/run and
 * POST /api/judge/submit — the "Judge execution contract" (execution-
 * contract audit, item #3).
 *
 * Added after a production incident where the two sides of this
 * contract silently drifted apart:
 *
 *   - src/services/judgeService.js's runTestcases() was deliberately
 *     changed to stop sending `functionName` on Run, once
 *     backend/controllers/judgeController.js's runHandler started
 *     resolving it server-side from `problemSlug` (audit finding P1-1
 *     — never trust the client for the execution contract).
 *   - backend/routes/judge.js's Zod `runSchema`, however, still
 *     declared `functionName` as REQUIRED. validateBody() rejected
 *     every real Run request with a 400 before runHandler's resolution
 *     logic ever got a chance to run — surfaced to students as
 *     "Runner Unavailable."
 *
 * Nothing enforced that the object judgeService.js builds and the
 * object judge.js's Zod schema validates were the same shape, because
 * each side defined it independently. This module is the fix for
 * that: ONE plain-JS (no framework/runtime deps — safe to import from
 * both a Vite/browser bundle and a Node/Express backend) builder that
 * both sides use, so a future field being added/removed only has to
 * change in one place, and backend/routes/judge.contract.test.js can
 * assert this exact shape against the real Zod schema in CI.
 *
 * If you add or remove a field from what Run/Submit needs, change it
 * HERE first, then update:
 *   - backend/routes/judge.js (Zod runSchema/submitSchema)
 *   - backend/controllers/judgeController.js (runHandler/submitHandler)
 *   - backend/routes/judge.contract.test.js
 * in the same change. That's the whole point of this file existing.

 * copies.

/**

 * client-sent value for any of those is ignored whenever problemSlug
 * is set (audit finding P1-1). `problemSlug` is therefore the one
 * field that must always be present for a real (non-scratch) problem —
